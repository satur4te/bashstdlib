# Bash Standard Library
> ...too pretentious name, but it is straightforward enough to express our intentions

The crown jewel of this repository is the file `base.sha` that contains set of handy functions commonly used in our daily automation tasks,
but also it serves as example of the style guide we want to provide for Bash scripts.


## Usage
*Under construction...*


## TODO
- [ ] Come up with the style guide draft;
- [ ] Refactor naming of the functions that is already implemented;
- [ ] Split the notorious `_E_PROCESS` function into two separate functions;
- [ ] Implement the function that returns the caller function name;
- [ ] Implement the function that returns the effective name of the script that is currently running;
